# SpringBoot-MultiThreadedFileProcessor
This repository showcases a robust solution for multi-threaded file processing using Spring Boot. Designed for efficiency, it enables the handling of large CSV files concurrently, significantly reducing processing times. The application accepts CSV files as input, validating each row against defined DTOs to ensure data integrity. Valid rows are saved to an H2 database, while any validation errors are logged to a JSON file for easy review. Built with Spring Boot, the project adheres to best practices in configuration and dependency management, offering a scalable architecture that can easily be extended to support additional threads and different file formats. Key technologies used include Spring Boot, Java Concurrency, File I/O, H2 Database, and Maven. To get started, simply clone the repository, set up your environment, and run the application to start processing CSV files effortlessly!
